Graph-Related Business Intelligence Layer (BIL)
Why Use Graph Technology?
Graph databases excel at modeling and analyzing relationships between entities. In our case, we can use graph structures to:

Uncover hidden connections between sessions.
Identify patterns indicative of gaming behavior or fraud.
Enhance user segmentation based on behavioral and device attributes.
Provide insights that are difficult to extract using traditional relational databases.
Key Graph Components Based on Schema
Nodes (Vertices):

Sessions: Each event id represents a session node.
Devices: Based on a combination of device attributes.
IP Addresses: If available (from geoLocation or other means).
Click Events: Individual actions from clickName.
Pages: Derived from pageInfo and eventData.
Locations: Geographic entities like country, city, and region.
Browsers and Operating Systems: From agentName, agentVersion, operatingSystemName, etc.
Edges (Relationships):

Session-to-Device: Connect sessions to devices based on device attributes.
Session-to-Location: Link sessions to geographic locations.
Session-to-Session: Establish relationships between sessions sharing common attributes.
Session-to-Click Event: Sequence of clicks within a session.
Device-to-Device: If devices share similar attributes, indicating possible shared usage.
Session-to-Browser/OS: Connect sessions to the browser and OS used.
3. Deeper and Convincing Use Cases
Use Case 1: Identifying Gaming Behavior
Objective:

Detect users attempting to game the system (e.g., clearing cookies to receive better offers) by identifying patterns of behavior and device usage across sessions.

Implementation:

Device Fingerprinting:

Composite Device ID: Create a hash or composite key from device attributes such as userAgent, deviceClass, operatingSystemNameVersion, screenResolution, and viewport.
Graph Construction:
Device Nodes: Represent unique composite device IDs.
Session Nodes: Each session connects to its corresponding device node.
Analysis:
Identify multiple sessions connected to the same device node but with different ids.
Look for patterns where sessions occur in close temporal proximity, suggesting the same user.
Business Value:

Fraud Prevention: Detect and mitigate attempts to exploit offers.
Offer Optimization: Adjust strategies to prevent gaming while maintaining user engagement.
Use Case 2: Session Pathway Analysis
Objective:

Analyze clickstream sequences to understand common user pathways and identify points of friction or drop-off.

Implementation:

Graph Construction:

Click Event Nodes: Each unique click or action.
Edges: Directed edges from one click event to the next within the same session.
Session Paths: Sequences of click events forming pathways.
Analysis:

Identify the most common pathways leading to successful conversions or exits.
Detect unusual or looping pathways that may indicate user confusion or technical issues.
Business Value:

User Experience Enhancement: Improve site navigation and layout based on common user paths.
Conversion Rate Optimization: Streamline pathways to desired outcomes (e.g., application completion).
Use Case 3: Geolocation and Regional Insights
Objective:

Leverage geographic data to understand regional engagement and tailor marketing efforts.

Implementation:

Graph Construction:

Location Nodes: Country, region, city.
Session Nodes: Connected to corresponding location nodes.
Device and Browser Nodes: Further enrich the graph with device usage by region.
Analysis:

Identify regions with high engagement or unusual activity.
Correlate device usage patterns with geographic locations.
Business Value:

Market Segmentation: Tailor offers and content to specific regions.
Resource Allocation: Focus marketing efforts where they are most effective.
Use Case 4: Device and Browser Compatibility Analysis
Objective:

Determine if certain devices or browsers are associated with higher bounce rates or errors.

Implementation:

Graph Construction:

Browser Nodes: From agentName and agentVersion.
Operating System Nodes: From operatingSystemName and operatingSystemVersion.
Edges: Connect sessions to their respective browser and OS nodes.
Analysis:

Identify clusters of sessions with short durations or high error rates linked to specific browsers or OS versions.
Detect trends over time as new versions are released.
Business Value:

Technical Optimization: Prioritize compatibility fixes for problematic devices or browsers.
User Satisfaction: Improve overall user experience, reducing bounce rates.
Use Case 5: Temporal Activity Patterns
Objective:

Analyze session activity over time to identify peak usage periods and anomalous behavior.

Implementation:

Graph Construction:

Time Nodes: Representing hours, days, or other time intervals.
Edges: Connect sessions to their corresponding time nodes.
Analysis:

Identify patterns of activity spikes or lulls
Detect unusual activity at odd hours, which may indicate automated bots or fraudulent activity.
Business Value:

Operational Planning: Allocate resources during peak times.
Security Measures: Implement additional verification during periods of anomalous activity.s
