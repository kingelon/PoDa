Device Fingerprinting:

Purpose: Identify devices based on unique characteristics, even without cookies or GUIDs.
Method: Collect attributes like browser type, screen resolution, installed fonts, and operating system details to create a unique device profile.
Considerations: While effective, device fingerprinting raises privacy concerns and may be restricted by regulations.
2. Behavioral Analysis:

Purpose: Detect patterns indicative of offer manipulation.
Method: Monitor metrics such as:
Session Frequency: Unusually high visit rates.
Navigation Patterns: Repeated sequences of actions.
Time Spent: Consistently short sessions.
Implementation: Use machine learning models to identify anomalies in user behavior.
3. IP Address Monitoring:

Purpose: Track users based on their network location.
Method: Log IP addresses and correlate them with user activities.
Limitations: Dynamic IPs and shared networks can reduce reliability.
