Our Progress: We have laid a solid foundation for a real-time data processing pipeline. The basics are in place, and itâ€™s designed with scalability and extendability in mind. However, it is still in the early stages and would need further development to match the robustness, scalability, and complexity of a full-scale enterprise solution.

Next Steps: To move toward a more comprehensive framework, we would need to focus on enhancing scalability, adding resilience, improving monitoring, integrating security measures, and automating deployment. This would bring our setup closer to the standards of large-scale projects.
