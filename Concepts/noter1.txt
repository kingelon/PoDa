Our Progress: We have laid a solid foundation for a real-time data processing pipeline. While the current setup is basic, itâ€™s designed with scalability and flexibility in mind to accommodate new data sources and evolving business logic. However, it is still in the early stages and would need further development to match the robustness, scalability, and complexity of a full-scale enterprise solution.

Next Steps: To move toward a more comprehensive framework, we would need to focus on enhancing scalability, adding resilience, improving monitoring, integrating security measures, and automating deployment. Additionally, as more data sources and business logic are defined, the pipeline should be extended to integrate these new elements seamlessly.
